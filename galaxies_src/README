populate.cpp contains the HOD implementation.

There are also tools to measure power spectrum multipoles in periodic
simulation boxes (used for preliminary tests on QUIJOTE), using
interpolation of particles to a mesh.
Also provided is some implementation of a marked power spectrum.

The stuff with zobov was an aborted attempt to make zobov better.

Also provided are tools to read bigfile and hdf5 halo catalogs.

The source compiles to a python-usable dynamic library, defined
in pyapi.cpp (using pybind11).
A small utility is provided in enum_dispatch.h, turning template
arguments into dynamic ones (to be used from python). It automatically
ensures that all needed template specializations are compiled.
